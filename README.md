# Technologies #
FastAPI (Backend Server):FastAPI is used to build a robust backend server. FastAPI, developed by Sebastien Ramirez, is a modern web framework that utilizes ASGI, offering lightning-fast response times. One notable advantage is its support for coroutines and concurrency without the need for importing the ASYNCIO module in Python.

MongoDB (Backend Database Server): MongoDB serves as our backend database server, providing seamless data persistence. This NoSQL database is a reliable choice for handling large volumes of data and ensuring efficient data retrieval.

# FastAPI Highlights #
FastAPI brings several advantages to the table:

Performance: Thanks to ASGI implementation, FastAPI ensures lightning-fast response times, surpassing traditional frameworks like Express (used in MEAN and MERN stacks).

Concurrency: FastAPI supports coroutines and concurrency without the need for importing the ASYNCIO module in Python.

Interactive API Documentation: FastAPI simplifies testing of various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) through interactive API documentation. Leveraging OpenAPI, which is based on JSON schema, this feature allows visual testing of different API endpoints.
